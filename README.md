# CS3330 Assignment 2

### Project Description

This project uses Java to read student data from a text file and manage information
about them. A 'Student' Class and a 'StudentManager' Class are created for the program 
in order to organize the data and handle the main logic for the methods we implemented.
The program reads in data from a file, initializes and prints student objects, searches
for students by their ID number, and updates students' grades. 

### Dependencies
